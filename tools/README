These are the tools I use for my personal web page authoring.

The scripts can be improved to process just the modified files (and to
be less hacky in general), the XSLTs can be made more generic, but it
works for now, and is pretty simple.


Editing:
- skeleton.xml is the primary skeleton to start with, for *.xhtml
  files in ~/homepage/src/.

This stage is mostly needed to get unified styles, metadata
properties, and other bits in case if I'll change them. The same can
be achieved by processing (X)HTML files, but such a processing may get
tricky, and it's also nicer to have a less verbose skeleton.

Editing is done with the emacs html-mode, with

HTML:

- xml-to-html.sh translates source files into actual (X)HTML in
  ~/homepage/ by applying xml-to-html.xsl to them.


Atom feed:

- html-to-atom-dump.xsl dumps HTML files into a single atom feed.
- atom-sort.xsl sorts those by modification date.
- atom-limit.xsl limits them, taking the newest entries.
- html-to-atom.sh finds source files, and pipes them through the
  XSLTs.


Publishing:

- publish.sh runs the above two and uploads the files with rsync.
